# 3.Download Mixly

**(1) Download Mixly**

**① Introduction for Mixly**

Mixly is a free open-source graphical Arduino programming software, based on Google’s Blockly graphical programming framework, and developed by Mixly Team@ BNU.

It is a free open-source graphical programming tool for creative electronic development; a complete support ecosystem for creative e-education; a stage for maker educators to realize their dreams.

Although there is an Ardublock graphical programming software launched by Arduino official, Ardublock is not perfect enough, and many common functions cannot be realized.

**②Download and install Mixly1.0 software**

There are two kind installation packages provided for you in the following links:

[Mixly1.0 for Win 7/8/10](http://116.62.49.166/Mixly_WIN.7z)：<https://fs.keyestudio.com/Mixly1-Windows>

[Mixly1.0 for Mac](https://116.62.49.166/MixlyMac.zip)：<https://fs.keyestudio.com/Mixly1-MACOS>

**Windows version：**

We will take Mixly1.0 (Windows version) as example.

**Install Software：**

You will get installation package after downloading. As shown below:

![](media/2c120c5b3e52fbec94b62b48a016a4d5.png)

Unzip the package, you will see “Mixly 1.0 for keyestudio.exe”

![](media/f8201facff78d06aad9ced9f5fe65e0f.png)

Double-click ”![](media/8ec85e7035e6acc2271635f7c03dfc8e.png)Mixly 1.0 for keyestudio.exe”, the following interface pops up.

![](media/3b4de4ee8a8535e2e316c38e4c95e28f.png)

We have to choose correct Arduino development board and name, as shown below:

![](media/afbba18511c277cd0cf580353d22ac7f.png)

Select correct COM port(the corresponding port will be shown after installing driver successfully).

![](media/cf570d717ad63f4d9c1793dcdbd65254.png)

You have to know the function of every area and interface on Mixly software before uploading program on Arduino development board.

More information about Mixly 1.0 for keyestudio：<https://wiki.keyestudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Mixly1.0>

**（2）Install the driver of the development board**

Next, we will introduce the driver of the development board. The driver installation may have slight differences in different computer systems. So in the following let’s take an example of the driver installation in the WINDOWS system.

Mixly 1.0 for keyestudio folder contains its software and driver files. Before we launch the Mixly software, you only need to install the USB drivers.

Double-click the Mixly 1.0 for keyestudio folder—\> arduino—\>drivers

The driver files are shown below:

## Project 2: LED Light

**Overview**

To start off the EASY Plug sensor module, we will work on an LED. That’s right - it is as simple as turning a light on and off. It might not seem like much, but establishing this important baseline will give you a solid foundation as we work toward more complex experiment.

![](media/1e0f9d616acddd0b819d1b9b8bc2cba5.jpeg)

**Component Required:**

-   EASY plug control board\*1

-   EASY plug LED Module \*3

-   RJ11 cable\*1

-   USB cable\*1

**Component Introduction:**

**EASY plug LED Module**

The LED light modules have shiny colors, ideal for Arduino starters. It can be easily connected to IO/Sensor shield.

Note: this module needs to be used together with EASY plug control board. You can also choose other LED to emit different color of light like white, blue, green, yellow and red.

-   Sensor type: Digital

-   Interface: Easy plug

-   PH2.54 socket

**Connect It Up**

Connect the EASY Plug LED module to control board using an RJ11 cable.

![](media/7274490ccbda3d077ebea396a9c32269.png)

**Example 1: Light up LED**

**Upload the Code**

Below is an example code for lighting up an LED.

![](media/fd0e3ff9a42f7d1994d400342b0377c9.png)

**What You Should See**

![](media/5175e1083e4e6bc28107017838449e6d.png)

The LED is turned on. If it doesn’t, make sure you have assembled the circuit correctly and verified and uploaded the code to your board.

![](media/d98d231d5c7d03882e1ccbb593efa1e1.jpeg)

**Example 2: LED Blink**

**Test Code**

![](media/7eb154a263f9f3e1c766eefa86756414.png)

**What You Should See**

![](media/ee0c6ef2bf76d19b7fc0126c26278519.png)

The LED will flash on for one second, then blink off for one second.

![](media/d98d231d5c7d03882e1ccbb593efa1e1.jpeg)

If it doesn’t, make sure you have assembled the circuit correctly and verified and uploaded the code to your board.

**Little Knowledge:**

If you want to make the LED flash on and off more quickly or slowly, you can modify the Delay time here.

![](media/86acbdd1bdfb9e7b5a752d09fa4f3e0f.png)

Thank you! Enjoy the following programming.

**Example 3: LED Breath**

Here do you know how to connect the LED module? Check the code.

**Test Code**

Below is an example code for one LED breathing.

![](media/ff7603ce17d30f244703f719322916d0.png)

**Little Knowledge:**

Here no connection diagram, which port should you choose? Yeah, Pin 5.

See the code, you can modify the connection pin here.

![](media/ee3bb11ff35fdfc7563a1f4892b53ff1.png)

**What You Should See**

The LED gradually becomes brighter for one second, then gradually dimming for one second.

![](media/d98d231d5c7d03882e1ccbb593efa1e1.jpeg)

If it doesn’t, make sure you have assembled the circuit correctly and verified and uploaded the code to your board.

**Example 4: Brighten and Dim**

**Hookup Guide**

Connect the three EASY Plug LED modules to control board using RJ11 cables.

![](media/c13281b383e111d8b51c9b73653ea5b4.jpeg)

**Upload the Code**

Below is an example code for three LED modules experiment.

![](media/1bedaf4079c78944842dc7329db0fb25.png)

![](media/1d935da93335a93c5e24dfed1df4ef41.png)

**What You Should See**

The three LEDs are gradually brighter then gradually off one by one, circularly.

If it doesn’t, make sure you have assembled the circuit correctly and verified and uploaded the code to your board.

![](media/3f921c74021bfdc202ec879e77ea1122.jpeg)

![](media/0a46835ff0f50eeb2eaae6f8a4f01415.jpeg)

![](media/ba3b7729c39631c3ac0e35b730a0af92.jpeg)

**Troubleshooting:**

-   **LED Not Lighting Up?**

If upload the code successfully, but LED still not lights up. Make sure your board and LED module are connected correctly.

-   **Program Not Uploading?**

This happens sometimes, the most likely case is a confused Board and serial port, you should firstly select your proper board and port.

OLED is short for organic light emitting diode. On the microscopic level, an OLED display is a matrix of organic LEDs that light up when they emit energy.

Our EASY Plug OLED displays are perfect when you need a small display with vivid, high-contrast color. The visible portion of the OLED measures 0.96" diagonal and contains 128 x 64 pixels.

An OLED display works without a backlight. Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD).

In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD.

OLED technology is used in commercial applications such as displays for mobile phones and portable digital media players, car radios and digital cameras among others.

Specifications:

-   0.96" diagonal OLED

-   Pixels: 128 × 64

-   Color Depth: Monochrome (White)
